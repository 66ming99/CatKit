Welcome to CatKit! A staging ground for computational tools which are generally useful for catalysis.

* Molecule enumeration

[[./images/reaction-network.png]]

Currently, the only utility is an enumeration of molecular structures in graph from. What makes this tool useful? Its goal is to be a comprehensive search of all possible chemical structures and the reaction mechanisms which connect them. This includes searching for:

** Thermodynamics:
[X] - Various chemical species (C, H, and O currently tested)
[X] - Molecules with single bonds
[ ] - Molecules with double bonds
[ ] - Molecules with triple bonds

[ ] - Molecules with single cyclical groups
[ ] - Molecules with double cyclical groups
[ ] - Molecules with triple cyclical groups

[ ] - Chiral carbon molecules
[ ] - cis-trans isomers

** Kinetics:

[X] - Addition and Reduction reactions (R1 + R2 <--> P1)
[ ] - Bond formation / breaking pathways (R1 <--> P1)
[ ] - Reconfiguration reactions (R1 <--> R1*)
[ ] - Substitution reactions (R1 + R2 <--> P1 + P2)

X - Currently implemented features

Example usage:

Below is an example script which generates some simple figures using [[https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/index.html][NetworkX]] code for all molecules up to C2 H6.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer
from pathways import ReactionNetwork
import time

start = time.time()

db_name = 'networks/single-bonds-C2H6.db'

with ReactionNetwork(db_name=db_name) as rn:
    molecules = rn.molecule_search(
        element_pool={'C': 2, 'H': 6})
    rn.save_molecules(molecules)

    molecule_data = rn.load_molecules()

    cnt = 0
    for tag, molecules in molecule_data.items():
        for molecule in molecules:
            rn.plot_molecule(
                molecule,
                file_name='./images/tmp-molecule-{}.png'.format(cnt))
            print('[[./images/tmp-molecule-{}.png]]'.format(cnt))
            cnt += 1

    pathways = rn.path_search()
    rn.save_pathways(pathways)

    rn.plot_reaction_network(file_name='./images/reaction-network.png')

print('Process completed in {:.1f}s'.format(time.time() - start))
